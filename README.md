## Challenges

1. 🌐 Hosting: Challenges related to deploying and hosting the web application reliably and at scale.
2. 📦 Integrating MongoDB: Challenges in integrating and managing the MongoDB database for data integrity and seamless functionality.
3. 📚 Learning ReactJS: Learning curves and challenges associated with mastering ReactJS and its associated libraries and frameworks.

## How We Built It

Spendsence was developed using the following technologies:

- **ReactJS**: We utilized ReactJS, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, to create the front-end of Spendsence. ReactJS allowed us to create reusable components, manage state efficiently, and ensure a responsive and interactive user interface.

- **Node.js and Express**: The server-side of Spendsence was built using Node.js and Express. Node.js provided a scalable and event-driven runtime environment for executing JavaScript code on the server-side. Express, a minimalistic web application framework, made it easy to handle HTTP requests, manage routes, and integrate middleware.

- **MongoDB**: We chose MongoDB, a popular NoSQL document database, as the data storage solution for Spendsence. MongoDB's flexible document-oriented nature allowed us to store user profiles, income, and expense data efficiently. It provided scalability and easy schema changes, making it suitable for the dynamic nature of financial data.

- **Mongoose**: Mongoose, an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, simplified our interactions with the database. It provided schema validation, query building, and data manipulation capabilities, ensuring a structured approach to managing data and maintaining data integrity.

- **Axios**: Axios, a promise-based HTTP client, facilitated communication between the front-end and back-end of Spendsence. It allowed us to make HTTP requests from the client-side to the server-side API endpoints, ensuring smooth data flow and real-time updates.

Throughout the development process, we followed agile methodologies for project management, enabling effective collaboration among team members. We used Git for version control, allowing us to track and manage code changes efficiently.

We emphasized writing clean and maintainable code, following best practices and industry standards. Regular testing and debugging were conducted to ensure the stability and reliability of the application.
